<p>My name is Vina Nguyen and I am a fourth-year student pursuing a Bachelor degree in Computer Science and I expect to graduate in 2019. Currently I am a lab monitor at the College of Liberal Arts and an undergraduate research assistant at the department of Computer Science.
During the 2018 Summer, I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Indrakshi Ray and graduate student Hossein Shirazi in a project. I learned a lot of new things from them.
In my free time, I enjoy hiking, listening to music and watching anime.</p>
